AR Design (Augmented Reality Application)

Augmented reality project that aims at the practicality of users and interior designers.
Where furniture and decoration objects are designed in 3D in their real size.
Objects are projected to the real environment giving the user a better idea if the size will be compatible
with the environment, or if the decor was as expected.

For the development of this Augmented Reality application, the Unity 3D tool was used, normally this tool is widely used for the development and creation of games, such as games for computers, mobile Virtual Reality and even Augmented Reality. The programming language used for this project was C#.
The C# programming language (pronounced â€œC Sharp) is a modern, object-oriented, and strongly typed programming language. This language allows developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run on .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and programmers in C, C++, Java and JavaScript will immediately recognize it for its similarity to both.

On the home screen of the AR Design app, the software uses the cell phone's camera to detect planes, that is, checking whether or not there is a flat space for objects to be positioned correctly, in addition to the buttons to exit the app and share of image. For image sharing, a plugin is used that is inserted into Unity 3D called Native Share , which helps to capture the image and share it. When the middle button is pressed, a new tab will open that is the selection of items, as shown in the figure below.

In the Items Menu navigation screen, there is a list with the images, name and description of each item, being able to go to the side to see more items related to decoration or furniture. When selecting an item, it will go to the screen where it can be positioned, rotating or deleting this item.
